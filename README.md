# SeniorProject
This project was intended to be a Mentorship program where individuals could sign up to become a mentor for current students at Eastern Washington University. 
Project documentation can be found in the Documentation directory, which also includes a Presentation directory. This contains the PowerPoint presentation that my team used as our final presentation. Additionally, there is Database information, and documentation aimed towards everyday Users and technical support/programmers that might have been supporting the application in the future.\

---NOTE---
If I could start this project from the beginning, I would have suggested to my team to create directories pertaining to different portions of the project to increase the organization of the file structure in the project.
Near the end of the project, my team discovered the the Profile.php and AccountCreation.php were not protecting against html injection and sql injection properly, so I created the second editions to add to the project structure as a guideline for any individuals continuing this project in the future. Unfortunately, I did not get to extensively test these files as much as I would like, but as far as I was able to see they were working as intended.
